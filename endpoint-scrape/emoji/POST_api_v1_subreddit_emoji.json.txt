   Add an emoji to the DB by posting a message on emoji_upload_q.
A job processor that listens on a queue, uses the s3_key provided
in the request to locate the image in S3 Temp Bucket and moves it
to the PERM bucket. It also adds it to the DB using name as the column
and sr_fullname as the key and sends the status on the websocket URL
that is provided as part of this response.
  </p>
  <p>
   This endpoint should also be used to update custom subreddit emojis
with new images. If only the permissions on an emoji require updating
the POST_emoji_permissions endpoint should be requested, instead.
